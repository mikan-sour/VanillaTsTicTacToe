# Vanilla JS Tic Tac Toe (With Typescript, MVC, and Vite)

## Special thanks

## About this repo
* I needed to brush up on my vanilla js - It'd been a while since I had done some good ol' fashioned DOM manipulation...
* It's a simple tic-tac-toe game
* Tried to use Vite to see what all the fuss was (it's pretty cool and easy to use!)
  
## To Do

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Tighten up some of the typings (add a generic for Listeners method in Event class)
- [ ] Get fancier with the SCSS
